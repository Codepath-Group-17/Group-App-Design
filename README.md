# SpaceRenter

### App Description
A mobile app that allows **sellers** to rent out equipment they own to **buyers** in the area in order to achieve a lower price.

### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile: Ease of use, location, audio/chat, camera

- Story: Allows people to rent different spaces for different activities

- Market: Any person that has equipment avaliable for rental, and any person that would like to rent equiptment or a space

- Habit: Depends on who the user is; a music producer for example, would use it a lot if they need time to make music with equipment they don't own

- Scope 
    - **V1**: Allows the user to see potential space offerings and see open time slots. Security and ID for those who are renting their things out. Seller can post listings with what equipment they have available, with basic instructions on how to use it.
    - **V2**: They should also be able to pay through the app so that we make a percentage of the payment in order to fund more progress.
    - **V3**: Waitlist/Booking schedule for renters to schedule times.
